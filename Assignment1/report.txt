Q3 Analysis
25 Points
What tools and observations were used to figure out the cryptosystem? (Explain in less than 100 words)
To solve this substitution cipher, we use “mc_assign1_edited.cpp” code. 

The observation for substitution is following.
Y&M has high frequency and "MEY" apears 5 times, so fair assumption M-t,E-h,Y-e.
Single letter “P” can be "a" or 'i' and we choose P-a. “Wt” is guessed as ‘it’, so W-i. 
From “e!th” where exclamation mark in between a word and "thi AiAtheT" (on last line) we can infer about jumbled arrangement of spaces, as substituting A-s and rearranging spaces we get "this is the T".
After managing spaces we infer the words “JessaRe”-“message”, “Sest”-“rest”, “Tirst”-“first”
“Gf iHterest”-“of interest”, “IhamOer”-“chammer”, “IaBes”-“caves”, “Kater”-“later”, “Vill”-“will”,  “Flaces”-“places”, “passworU”-“password”, “sNbstitNtion”,“substitution”, “Xou”-“you”, “Duotes”,-“Quotes”.

As mentioned in cipher, digits are shifted by 8 and our decryption tool ignores digits
so, we know 8 is also an shifted digit (ciphertext). so, actual digit is x which is shifted by x
so 2x mod 10 = 8. hence, x can be 4 or 9.
Now we tried possible passwords by shifting digits in password by 4 and 9 until level 0 gets cracked. We get correct digits in password( 6 and 9 respectively)  by shifting 0 and 3 by 4. 

Q4 Mapping
10 Points
What is the plaintext space and ciphertext space? What is the mapping between the elements of plaintext space and the elements of ciphertext space? (Explain in less than 100 words)

Plaintext space and ciphertext space are the sets of strings composed of {'a','b',..'z'} U {'A','B',..'Z'} U {0,1,..9}.
The mapping between elements of ciphertext and plaintext space.
